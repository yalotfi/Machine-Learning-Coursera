# Coursera Machine Learning

Andrew Ng's Stanford course on Machine Learning is one of the most well known introductions to the field. It provides intuition for various learning algorithms and their implementations without the need to already be an experienced mathematician or programmer. It is designed to be machine learning without a PhD!

## Implementation
Assignments are implemented in MATLAB/Octave.  The course provides helper functions for things like plotting or processing data, but the core implementation of each algorithm is done by me.

## Snapshot of the Course Matieral:
1. Linear Regression and Batch Gradient Descent
2. Logistic Regression and Regularization
3. Neural Network Representation
4. NN Learning and Backpropogation
5. Support Vector Machines
6. Unsupervised Learning and Clustering
7. Dimensionality Reduction
8. Anomaly Detection
9. Recommender Systems
10. System Design for ML
11. Photo OCR for Computer Vision
